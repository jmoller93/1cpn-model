1CPN model documentation
======================================

1CPN Website: https://lequieu.github.io/1cpn-model/ 
1CPN GitHub: https://github.com/lequieu/1cpn-model

The documentation here is for the 1CPN model implementation in LAMMPS. If you haven't read the 1CPN paper yet, it might be a good idea to read this first. 

Lequieu, Cordoba, Moller, de Pablo "1CPN: A coarse-grained multi-scale model of chromatin" (2019) J. Chem. Phys.

In everything that follows, we'll be describing the technical details of 1CPN without much regard to why we're discussing them.

If in doubt, start with the "quickstart" guide.
