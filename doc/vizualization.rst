Vizualization of 1CPN
==================

Each site in the 1CPN model is represented by an anisotropic potential, where both the orientation and the position of a site.

Most mainstream tools for vizualizing molecular trajectories (such as `VMD <http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/>`_), represent each site by a sphere, which is insufficient.
